# odin-to-do-list

Practice eveything you learned about webpack and OOP principles with a project that ties these techniques together.

Requirements:

Create a to-do list using objects that are dynamically created, either by factories on constructors/classes.

To-do items should include a title, description, due date and priority. Lists should have different projects or categories.

You should separate your application logic from the DOM-related stuff.

Add some persistence to this todo app using the Web Storage API.
